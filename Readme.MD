Simplest DI(Dependency Injection)
Author: Perry Loh (perry.loh@gmail.com)

My code kata exercise in making the *simplest* dependency injection framework in .NET. It's not meant to be compared to the full fledged DI frameworks available. However, my purpose was to see what would've been a DI framework that could work, as a proof-of-concept.

It demonstrates usage of the following .NET mechanisms:
- Collections 
- Generics
- Reflection
- Activator
