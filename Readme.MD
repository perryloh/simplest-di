Simplest DI(Dependency Injection)
Author: Perry Loh (perry.loh@gmail.com)

My code kata exercise in making the simplest dependency injection framework in .NET. It's not meant to be compared to the full fledged DI frameworks available. However, my purpose was to see what would've been the simplest DI framework that could work, in terms of a simple proof-of-concept.

It demonstrates usage of the following .NET mechanisms:
- Collections 
- Generics
- Reflection
- Activator
